## Project Description
The Drink Finder is a web application designed to help users quickly find drinks from a predefined list by typing a letter or sequence of letters into a search bar. The application dynamically filters the list of drinks based on the user's input, providing an efficient way to locate specific beverages.


### Features
Search Bar: A user-friendly search bar where users can type letters to filter the list of drinks.  
Dynamic Filtering: As the user types in the search bar, the list of drinks updates in real-time to show only the drinks that match the entered letters.  
Predefined Drink List: A comprehensive list of drinks that users can search through.  
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be accessible and functional on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.  


### Technologies Used
JavaScript: Handles the logic for filtering the list of drinks based on user input and updating the user interface dynamically.  
HTML: Structures the content of the application, including the search bar and the list of drinks.  
CSS: Styles the application to create an appealing and user-friendly interface, with responsive design principles.  


### How It Works
User Input: The user types a letter or sequence of letters into the search bar.  
Dynamic Filtering: JavaScript captures the user's input and filters the list of drinks to display only those that contain the entered letters.  
Display Results: The filtered list of drinks is displayed in real-time, updating as the user continues to type.  

The project helped me consolidate my existing knowledge and gain experience in writing code in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
